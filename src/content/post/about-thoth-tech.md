Thoth Tech, a beacon of innovation in the bustling tech scene of Melbourne, Australia, is not your ordinary software development company. Established in 2022, our mission is as thrilling as it gets: revolutionizing education through the power of technology. Picture this: we're crafting digital tools that transform the learning journey for students worldwide, empowering them to unlock their full potential, connect with mentors, and embark on personalized educational adventures.

At Thoth Tech, we value every member of our team like family, and our commitment to excellence shines through in everything we do. We believe in creating a supportive and nurturing environment where creativity flourishes, ideas thrive, and magic happens.

Now, let's delve into the enchanting realms of our projects:

## Company Operations: Make the process easier
Embark on a journey with Quest, where we streamline initiation processes, enrich our internal wisdom treasury, craft our digital identity, and enhance our knowledge repository. To wield the magic of Quest, you'll need skills in TypeScript, Astro (our celestial architect), and Markdown (the language of lore).

## OnTrack: Chart Your Course to Success
Join the OnTrack team as we elevate education through the alchemy of task transformation, interface refinement, and data insights summoning. Harness the power of Ruby on Rails, Angular.js, and TypeScript to weave spells of code.

## SplashKit: Crafting Realms of Wonder
At SplashKit, we inspire aspiring magicians to create realms of wonder through games and interactive marvels. Dive into the enchantments of C# or C/C++, Splashkit library, and Raspberry Pi to unlock the gateway to nostalgia.

## CourseFlow: Pioneering the Path to Graduation
Join CourseFlow on our quest to simplify academia's labyrinth and illuminate the road to graduation. Master the magic of TypeScript, Angular, C#, ASP.NET, MongoDB, and Python to weave the tapestry of learning.

Accompanied by the scrolls of collaboration (Git & GitHub), the canvas of imagination (Figma), the tavern of camaraderie (Microsoft Teams), and the sanctums of creation (Various IDEs, Docker), your journey at Thoth Tech promises to be nothing short of extraordinary.

If you possess the skills and passion to embark on this magical journey with us, we warmly welcome your addition to our team! But remember, Thoth Tech is a haven for tech enthusiasts and Capstone project aficionados. So, before you leap into the adventure, ensure your skills align with our quests. After all, it's not just about joining a company; it's about becoming part of a magical journey that shapes the future of education.
